# Introduction
This project was initially a class project for our Web Programming class. We built a dating site called Icebreakr. It is built on the premise of prioritizing conversations between users.  
# Availability  
The website is currently hosted at weave.cs.nmt.edu/apollo9/Icebreakr/. The website and its database will be wiped from this location the next time the Web Programming class is offered (likely Fall 2021). Should it become available again, the new domain will be posted in this document.
